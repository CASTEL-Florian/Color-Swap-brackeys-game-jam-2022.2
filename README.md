# Color Swap

Color Swap is a game made alone during a week for Brackeys Game Jam 2022.2 on the theme "You're not alone".


Swap between two characters to defeat waves of enemies.

Enemies attack the character of the same color while you can only damage enemies of the opposite color. There is also friendly fire so you have to be careful not to shoot your ally.
